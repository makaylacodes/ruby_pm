# Project Management System

This is a project management system written in Ruby, Ruby on Rails. 

It allow users to create, read, and delete projects on their dashboard. Users can also create tasks inside the project and update their statuses. To use this program users must either sign in or sign up. When the user wishes to end their session, they have the option to logout.

It currently only runs locally. I will update this soon so that the program can run on a live server.
