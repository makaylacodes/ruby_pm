# README

This is a project manager written in Ruby on Rails. It currently only runs locally. I will update this soon so that the program can run on a live server. This project manager allows
users to create projects and add descriptions to them. Users can also create tasks inside the project and update the status of completion. To use this program users must either sign in or sign up. When the user wishes to end their session, they have the option to logout. Soon I will add the ability to use deadlines, drag and drop, and 2 factor authentication.
